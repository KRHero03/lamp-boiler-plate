# LAMP Boiler Plate
This is a standard LAMP Stack Boiler Plate where I made an Authentication and Profile system that can be readily used in Hackathons. 
It also allows users to delete their User Account. 
Just Fire up your Apache server, install the composer libraries and run the Boiler plate.


## Requirements

- Linux Operating System (xAMPP for Windows)
- Apache2
- MySQL
- PHP
- Composer

## Steps

### Install Apache2 Server and run it as a Service
```
sudo apt intall apache2 
sudo service apache2 start    
```

### Store the Boiler Plate code in the Apache2 root directory

### Install Composer and then the required library
```
sudo apt install composer
composer install
```

Hope it helps you make more projects during hackathons.
